# Cardiovascular Prediction

The dataset is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has a 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD). The dataset provides the patientsâ€™ information. It includes over 3310 records and 17 attributes
## Project Files Description

This project includes a colab notebook, a data source and a presentation:
## Problem Statement
We have to predict data those people suffereing cadiovascular disear uses various types of independent variables like BMI, BP, sex etc## Data Summary
data contain 3310 rows and 17 columns and null values are also present in data and duplicate values are not present
## Data Insights:
The comparisons between different variables are easy and convenient. It is the easiest diagram to prepare and does not require too much effort. It is the most widely used method of data representation. Therefore, it is used by various industries. It is used to compare data sets. Data sets are independent of one another. It helps in studying patterns over long periods of time.
As the age increases risk increases. Seems like a very important feature. Risk is marginally more in case of Male . Smokers and non-smokers have equal risk probabilities.
50% of people who have history of BP medication are prone to risk. BP medication feature is heavily imbalanced.
Prevalent feature is heavily imbalanced.
Prevalent hypertensive people are highly prone to risk.
Diabetes feature is heavily imbalanced.
People having total cholestrol more than 250 are more prone to risk. This feature has some outliers. Also, the classes are overlapping mostly.
People having systolic BP more than 130 are more to risk. Seems like a very important feature
People having diastolic more than 90 are more to risk. Classes are overlapping mostly.
## Conclusion
As the age increases risk increases. Seems like a very important feature. Risk is marginally more in case of Male . Smokers and non-smokers have equal risk probabilities.

50% of people who have history of BP medication are prone to risk. BP medication feature is heavily imbalanced.

Prevalent feature is heavily imbalanced.

Prevalent hypertensive people are highly prone to risk.

Diabetes feature is heavily imbalanced.

People having total cholestrol more than 250 are more prone to risk. This feature has some outliers. Also, the classes are overlapping mostly.

People having systolic BP more than 130 are more to risk. Seems like a very important feature

People having diastolic more

Randomforest classifier gives a better result than other models,in terms of Accuracy score,Auc score and F1_score whether a person has cardio or not with good accuracy of 80%
